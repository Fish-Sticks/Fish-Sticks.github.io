<p>Hello, I am Fishy!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a 17-year-old programmer from the United States, and my niche lies in bypassing security measures. I&rsquo;ve been actively coding since 2018, and in 2020, I delved into the fascinating world of reverse engineering. My coding journey began with Lua, and I quickly progressed to mastering C++. It all started with Roblox, which sparked my passion for programming. I primarily use Windows as my go-to operating system, only turning to Linux when the situation calls for it.</p>
<h1 id="interests">Interests<a href="#interests" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>My initial fascination with technology began with game development, but my curiosity led me down a different path when I discovered the intriguing world of game cheats. I became captivated by how they operated, which ignited my interest in reverse engineering and low-level programming languages. These interests have since evolved, and my current focus centers around developing assistance tools aimed at aiding individuals with their computing needs.</p>
<p>What I find particularly rewarding about reverse engineering is its capacity to unveil the inner workings and hidden intricacies of software. This skill not only allows me to explore software secrets but also equips me with the ability to assess whether a piece of software poses any potential risks or dangers.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I would like to express my gratitude for taking the time to peruse my profile and delve into my personal history. If you happen to have any inquiries or wish to engage in discussions pertaining to shared interests, please do not hesitate to reach out via message. I am readily available for any prospective conversations.</p>
